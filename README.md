- 👋 Hi, I’m gugu256/Evatzug
- 🇫🇷 I live in Paris, France
- 💻 I'm currently creating a personal C library & trying to contribute to open source projects
- 🌱 I'm trying to re-learn C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source Python, C and HTML/CSS projects
- 📫 How to reach me: my discord is `_.gugu._`, my e-mail is `gugu256@mail.com` (not @gmail.com, mail.com is an actual e-mail service)
